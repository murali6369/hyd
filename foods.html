                     is a style of biryani originating from Hyderabad, India made with basmati rice.
                     Hyderabad biryani is a key dish in Hyderabadi cuisine and 
                     it is so famous that the dish is considered synonymous with the city of Hyderabad.
                     the biryani is of South Indian origin, derived from pilaf varieties brought to South Asia 
                     by Arab traders. Pulao may have been an army dish in medieval India. Armies would prepare 
                     a one-pot dish of rice with whichever meat was available. The distinction between "pulao" 
                     and "biryani" is arbitrary
                     Base ingredients are basmati rice, dahi, fried onion and ghee. Spices include cinnamon, cloves,
                      cardamom (elaichi), bay leaves, nutmeg, papaya paste, caraway (shahi jeera),
                       mace flower (javitri), star anise (biryani flower), lemon, and saffron.</p>

                        In India, Mumbai, Pune and Hyderabad boast a number of Irani cafes,

                     cuisine made from a fermented batter of ground black gram and rice.
                      Dosas are served hot, often with chutney and sambar.
                      The dosa arrived in Mumbai with the opening of Udupi restaurants in the 1930s,
                      After India's independence in 1947, South Indian cuisine became gradually popular in North India. 
                      In New Delhi, the Madras Hotel in Connaught 
                      Place became one of the first restaurants to serve South Indian cuisine.
                      This place has been very popular among Hyderabadis who regularly visit DLF street food at Gachibowli.
                       They have a variety of south Indian breakfasts. The most sold are their Idlis and Ghee Karam Dosa.
                        They have a few branches in Hyderabad but the most crowded one is at Gachibowli. They also have the infamous "Ice Cream Dosa",

                      originating from Hyderabad, India.
                     It is a part of Hyderabadi cuisine and is a common feature at Hyderabadi wedding
                     Dried apricots from Afghanistan are especially prized for their flavour. 
                     Khubani ka meetha is a very popular dessert of India's Hyderabadi cuisine.
                     Preparation of the dish involves boiling apricots with syrup until they assume 
                     the consistency of a thick soup or compote. The dessert is topped with blanched almonds or apricot kernels,
                      and is traditionally garnished with malai (extra thick cream, ideally from buffalo milk), 
                      but also with custard or ice cream. 
                     The dessert is normally served hot with malai.
